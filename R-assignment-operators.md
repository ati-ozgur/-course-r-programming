# R-assignment-operators

in R, we can use following operators for assignment.


    ‘-> ->>’           rightwards assignment
    ‘<- <<-’           assignment (right to left)
    ‘=’                assignment (right to left)


I am used to using = for most situations since other programming languages use it.
But <- operator also works and can be see in in R examples in the internet.
