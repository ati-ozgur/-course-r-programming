# RMarkdown


## Introduction

R markdown is similar to notebooks (jupyter/mathematica) in that it contains both document and executable code.

Using R Studio, it is very easy to create RMarkdown documents.
But even without RStudio, RMarkdown documents can be executed, leading to very easy report automation.


## Code Chunks
Using delimiters ```{r} and ```, we can write any R code.
Output of these code chunks, automatically inserted to our document outputs.
This way, we can easily add graphs and table output to our reports.

Our code chunks could have following arguments

- include = FALSE 

	If this is TRUE, our code chunk and its output is automatically inserted to output document. Normally this is not what we want, therefore, its default value is false. Note that, the code still runs in the background.

- echo = FALSE 

	Here code is not inserted but results are inserted to output document. Useful to insert table and figure output.

- message = FALSE
- warning = FALSE

Does messages and warnings generated by code is inserted to output documents.

- fig.cap = 

	By setting this value, you can add caption to figure output.
