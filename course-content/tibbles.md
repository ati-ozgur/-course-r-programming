# Tibbles

Tibbles are replacement for base-r data.frame class.
Since R language is an old language it is hard to make changes in the base features without breaking backward compatibility.
Tibble makes some changes so that working with data frames is more regular.
For example, base R data.frames has not regular return with operator [ ].
It may return vectors or data.frames.
For tibbles, it always return another tibble. 

This notes are summarized version of excellent [chapter for tibbles in R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html) book.

Start with loading tidyverse package.

	library(tidyverse)



## create a tibble
	df = tibble(
	  x = 1:10, 
	  y = 2 *x, 
	  z = x ^ 2 + y + 1
	)


## change data frame to tibble
	as_tibble(iris)
