## Graph (figure) types

###  line graph

Use a line graph to track changes over periods of time.
Bar graphs can also be used for same purpose but if variable number is higher than two, line graph is better.
Line graphs could be a better choice for data which has maximum and minimum points.

#### Examples 

- Monthly sales contributions of different departments in 2020.


###  pie chart

Use it when trying to compare parts of whole thing. 
Pie charts should be used for a data in a point of time.
They are not suitable for a changes over a period of time.

#### Examples 

- sales contribution of different departments in 2020.
- budget percentages of different departments in 2020.


### Bar Graph
Similar to line graph, it is used to track changes of periods of time.
But it is better when changes are larger and compared entities are less than three.

#### Examples 

- Monthly sales contributions of different departments in 2020.


### X-Y Plot 
X-Y plot could be different plots like scatter and line plots.
Use it to determine relationships between X and Y.
Do they increase or decrease together.

#### Examples 

### Area Graph
Similar to line graphs, they are used to track changes over time.
They could be a better choice when two parts of whole compared over time.

#### Examples 

- Monthly sales contributions of two departments in 2020.
