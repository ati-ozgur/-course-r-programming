# dplyr

dplyr is the data manipulation library of the tidyverse.
It is more easier to use compared to base-R library.


Most common operations are as below:

    - [mutate](dplyr-mutate.md) adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
    - [select](dplyr-select.md) picks variables based on their names.
    - [filter](dplyr-filter.md) picks cases based on their values.
    - [summarise](dplyr-summarise.md) reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
    - [arrange](dplyr-arrange.md) changes the ordering of the rows.
