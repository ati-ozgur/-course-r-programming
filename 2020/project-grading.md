# project grading

You will be graded from 3 Parts

1. Source code and R Markdown Report
I do not want a power point presentation.
The  R Markdown Report should be your presentation.
Please do not copy your code from other teams.
Helping each other is OK but you need to understand the code you have written.


2. You will record 10+ minutes presentation for me.
You may [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) for this purpose.
You need to use your webcam when recording the video.
You and your team-mate should divide the report by yourself.
60-40 percent division is OK but please do not make it 80-20.


3. Questions
According to your report and presentation, I may ask you questions.
I will be emailing teams for appointment if this is necessary.
