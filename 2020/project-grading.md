# project grading

You will be graded from 3 Parts

1. Source code and R Markdown Report
I do not want a power point presentation.
The  R Markdown Report should be your presentation

2. You will record 10+ minutes presentation for me.
You may [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) for this purpose.
You need to use your webcam when recording the video.
You and your team-mate should divide the report by yourself.


3. Questions
According to your report and presentation, I may ask you questions.
I will be emailing teams for appointment if this is necessary.
