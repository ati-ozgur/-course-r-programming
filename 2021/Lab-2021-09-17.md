1. Install R package [randomNames](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomNames/)

2. Generate 100 student names (first and last names) using random names package.

3. Generate 100 grades for above students.
Random number should have a mean of 70 with standard distribution of 15. Below functions, [rnorm](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/compositions/versions/2.0-2/topics/rnorm) and [floor](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Round.html) would be useful.


	rnorm(n, mean=a, sd=b)
	floor

4. Put student names and grades to one tibble (data frame)
You can use [as_tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/as_tibble.html) function for this purpose.
Your tibble should have at least 2 columns (names, grades). 

5. export this data frame as csv file, student_grades.csv.
